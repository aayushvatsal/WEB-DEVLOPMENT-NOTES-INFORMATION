    <h1><b>What is Javascript</b></h1>
    <p>JavaScript is a scripting or programming language that allows us to implement complex features on web pages</p>
    <h2><b>Features Of Javascript</b></h2>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Cross-platform</b>: Javascript is supported by many OS such as Windows, macOS, Linux, etc.
        </li>
        <li><b>Object Oriented</b>: Javascript is an object oriented programming language, but it is not a class based
            OOP language like Java, C++, etc. <br>
            It is a prototype based OOP language.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2><b>Scripting language:</b></h2>
    <p>Javascript is a scripting language it depends on the browser for the execution of scripts. <br>
        It is mostly used as a client-side scripting language this means that it runs on the client's system (browser)
        <br>
        and handles the webpages displayed to the user and the processing related to it such as cookies, sessions, local
        storage.</p>

    <h2><b>Dynamically typed:</b></h2>
    <p>Javascript is dynamically typed, it means type checks happen at run-time. In JS we don't have to explicitly
        declare what type of information will be stored in a variable in advance. <br>
        For example when we declare var a, now a can have a string stored in or a number as well.</p>

    <h2><b>Case sensitive:</b></h2>
    <p>Javascript is sensitive to the case of the letters.</p>

    <h2><b>Client Side use of Javascript</b></h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Javascript is mostly used for client side scripting. (Code is run on the client's browser)</li>
        <li>It can be used to modify the webpage's user interface (the browser and its DOM) and make pages interactive.
        </li>
        <li>It deals with client side processing like cookies, sessions.</li>
        <li>It deals with the storage of the web browser i.e local and session storage.</li>

    </ul>

    <h2><b>Server side use of JavaScript</b></h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Javascript can also be used to for server side development. This is possible because of Node.js.</li>
        <li>Node.js is an application runtime environment that allows us to use JavaScript for building server-side
            applications.</li>
        <li>We can do things like database queries, network requests, read/write files on the server, running web
            servers, interacting with other servers, handling data sent to the server, etc.</li>
        <li>Server side scripting is responsible for showing dynamic content on the webpage.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2><b> Javascript can be included in your HTML file in two ways:</b></h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Internal JS</li>
        <li>External JS</li>
    </ul>

    <h2><b>Internal JS :</b></h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Internal JS means the javascript code is written in the HTML file itself.</li>
        <pre>
                        <div class="syntax">
                         script >
                            //JS code
                          < /script> 
                        </div>    
                    </pre>
    </ul>

    <h2><b>External JS:</b></h2>
    <ul>
        <li>In external JS, the javascript code is written in another file with the .js extension. <br>
            A link to this JS file is added in the HTML file.</li>
        <li>We can do so by using the script tag and adding two attributes type and src, the type attribute has the
            value text/javascript" and the src attribute has the path to the JS file.</li>
    </ul>
    <pre>
                    <div class="syntax">
                    script type="text/javascript" src="script.js">< /script >  
                </div>
                </pre>

    <h3>We will use these three ways to print 'Hello, World!'</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>console.log()</li>
        <li>alert()</li>
        <li>document.write()</li>
    </ul>

    <h2><b>console.log</b></h2>

    script >
    console.log("Hello, World!")
    < /script>

        <h2><b>alert()</b></h2>

        script >
        alert("Hello, World!")
        < /script>

            <h2><b>document.write()</b></h2>

            script >
            document.write("Hello, World!")
            < /script>

                <script src="script.js"></script>
