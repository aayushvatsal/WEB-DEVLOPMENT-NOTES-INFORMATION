    <h1><b>JavaScript loop</b></h1>
    <p>The JavaScript loops are used to iterate the piece of code using for, while, do while or for-in loops. <br>
        It makes the code compact. It is mostly used in array.</p>

    <h3><b>Types Of Loop</b></h3>
    <ol>
        <li>for loop</li>
        <li>while loop</li>
        <li>do-while loop</li>
        <li>for-in loop</li>
    </ol>

    <h2><b>for loop</b></h2>
    <p>For loops in JavaScript are one of the most commonly used loop constructs. <br>
        <br>

        A for loop is an entry-controlled loop that repeats a block of code if the specified condition is met. <br>
        A for loop in JavaScriptis typically used to loop through a block of code multiple times.
    </p>

    <div class="example">

        for (initialising statement; conditional statement; updation statement) { <br>
        // code block to be executed <br>
        } <br>

        <br>
        <br>

        for (var i=1;i<=10;i++){ <br>
            console.log(i) <br>
            } <br>


    </div>

    <h2><b>While loop</b></h2>
    <p>A while loop executes the respective statements as long as the conditions are met. <br>
        As soon as the condition becomes false, the loop is terminated, and the control is passed on to the statement
        outside the loop. <br>
        It is important to note that while is an entry-controlled loop in JavaScript. This means that, like other
        entry-controlled loops, the conditional statement first needs to be evaluated. <br>
        If the conditions are met, only then is the counter variable updated.</p> <br>

    <div class="example">
        <h3><b>Syntax</b></h3>
        while (condition) { <br>
        // code block <br>
        } <br>

        <br>
        <br>
        Example :
        var i = 1;
        while (i <= 10) { console.log(i); i++; } </div>



<h2><b>Do While loop</b></h2>
<p>A do...while loop is an exit-controlled loop. This means that the do...while loop executes the block of code once
    without checking the condition. <br>
    After the code has been executed once, the condition is checked. If the condition is true, the code is executed
    further. If the condition is false, the loop is terminated. <br>
    <br>
    The do...while statement is used when you want to run a loop at least one time.
</p> <br>

<div class="example">
    do { <br>
    //code block to be executed <br>
    } <br>
    while (condition); <br>

    <br>
    <br>

    example: <br>
    let i = 1; <br>
    do { <br>
    console.log(i); <br>
    i++; <br>
    } while(i <= 10); <br>
</div>
